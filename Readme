NAME
    Date::Easter - Calculates Easter for any given year

SYNOPSIS
      use Date::Easter;
      ($month, $day) = julian_easter(1752);
      ($month, $day) = easter(1753);
      ($month, $day) = gregorian_easter(1753);

DESCRIPTION
    Calculates Easter for a given year.

    easter() is, for the moment, an alias to gregorian_easter(), since
    that's what most people use now.

To Do
    I need to put some real tests in test.pl

    Since the dates that various countries switched to the Gregorian
    calendar vary greatly, it's hard to figure out when to use which method.
    Perhaps some sort of locale checking would be cool?

Other Comments
    Yes, Date::Manip already has code in it to do this. But Date::Manip is
    very big, and rather slow. I needed something faster and smaller, and
    did not need all that other stuff. And I have a real interest in date
    calculations, so I thought this would be fun. Date::Manip is a very cool
    module. I use it myself.

    details on calculating Easter.
